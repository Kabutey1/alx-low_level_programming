# C - Hello, World

In this project, I learned about C-programming and the basics. 


## Betty Linter :ledger:
 
 * All codes were written in `Betty` style and checked with [Betty Linter](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
 * Install the linter with 
 ```sh
 sudo ./install.sh
 ```

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

 * **0. Preprocessor**
   * [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): A script that runs a C file through the processor and saves the result into another file.
   * The C file is saved in the variable `$CFILE`
   * The output is saved in the fie `c` 

 * **1. Compiler**
   * [1-compiler](./1-compiler): A script that compiles a C file but does not link. 


 * **2. Assembler**
   * [2-assembler](./2-assembler): A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. 

 * **3. Name**
   * [3-name](./3-name): A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`


 * **4. Hello,puts**
   [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): A C program that prints exactly `"programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.


 * **5. Hello, printf**
   * [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c): A C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but the putcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line.


 * **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
   * [6-size.c](./6-size.c): A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is sompiled and run on. 
   * Packages needed - `libc6-dev-i36` to test the `-m32``gcc` option

 * **7. Intel**
   * [100-intel](./100-intel): A script that generates assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. 

 * **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity. 
   * [101-quote.c](./101-quote.c): A C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar,  2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
